# Arbitrum Quickstart and Cost Analysis

Arbitrum is an L2 scaling solution for **Ethereum** developed by **Offchain Labs**. Using the **Optimistic Rollup** model, Arbitrum offers a variety of benefits, such as:

- **Minimum Cost**: Lower gas costs for many different transactions
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with EVM, no code modification needed 
- **Security**: Security is rooted in L1 and any one party can ensure the correct L2 results
- **Scalability**: By moving a big portion of contracts computation and storage off chain, much higher throughput is allowed in the chain



# Testnet Quickstart

Arbitum website https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet provides a very well documented guide on how access their public testnet. Step by step instruction can be found below:

- In the Metamask browser interface, connect to the Arbitum Testnet using custom RPC network option with the following information:

- To be able to transact with the chain,some amount of ETH will be required. Faucets such as [https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) can provide the neccessary ETH in the testnet to start experimenting.
- To send ETH or any other tokens to the L2 Testnet, visit [https://bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/). and simply choose the preffered amount of token to transfer. This  transfer requires a minimal gas fee.
- Now you are able to experiment in the Arbitrum Testnet. Different transactions in the L2 can be observed and inspected using https://explorer.arbitrum.io/.
