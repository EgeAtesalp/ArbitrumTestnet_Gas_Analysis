# Arbitrum Quickstart and Cost Analysis

Arbitrum is an L2 scaling solution for **Ethereum** developed by **Offchain Labs**. Using the **Optimistic Rollup** model, Arbitrum offers a variety of benefits, such as:

- **Minimum Cost**: Lower gas costs for many different transactions
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with EVM, no code modification needed 
- **Security**: Security is rooted in L1 and any one party can ensure the correct L2 results
- **Scalability**: By moving a big portion of contracts computation and storage off chain, much higher throughput is allowed in the chain
